Bonus: +2 For each of the scheduling algorithms, output the CPU utilization assuming that the dispatcher takes 1 units of time. CPU Utilization is the percentage time the CPU is idle. For example, for FCFS, if there is dispatcher time, the tasks will finish at 170. With dispatcher time, the tasks will finish at 177. CPU utilization is 170/177 = 96.04
